# Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA
# Example Project for Learning the Best Editor Tricks

This project will help you learn the best way to write code in IntelliJ IDEA.

The full tutorial for learning IntelliJ IDEA is in the book [Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Know-IntelliJ-IDEA-Professional/dp/B0CRGX26QK/), or you can learn via the self-paced training course [Working With Code in IntelliJ IDEa](https://leanpub.com/c/workingwithcodeinintellijidea).

To use these samples, open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. If you do not have a project open, choose "Get from VCS" from the Welcome Dialog.
4. If you already have a project open, go to the "Git" or "VCS" menu and select "Clone...".
3. Paste `https://github.com/Getting2KnowIJ/testing-code` into the URL input box, and select a location to clone the project to, and press the "Clone" button.

[This video](https://youtu.be/aBVOAnygcZw) shows a walkthrough of the process using the classic UI.

IntelliJ IDEA will download the code and set up a project for you to work with.
